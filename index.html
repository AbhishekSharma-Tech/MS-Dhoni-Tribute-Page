                Mahendra Singh Dhoni (commonly known as M. S. Dhoni) is an Indian cricketer who captained the
                Indian team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2016 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014.
                An attacking right-handed middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, he is widely regarded as one
                of the greatest finishers in limited-overs cricket. He made his One Day International (ODI) debut
                in December 2004 against Bangladesh, and played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka.

                <li><strong>December 23, 2004 : </strong>Makes his ODI debut against Bangladesh in Chittagong.
                    Is run out for 0 after facing one ball, in a match India win by 11 runs.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>April 5, 2005 : </strong>The first ODI hundred by an Indian wicketkeeper.
                    After scores of 0, 12, 7* and 3, Dhoni is sent up the order to No 3 against Pakistan in
                    Visakhapatnam
                    and proceeds to smash 148 off 123 balls with 15 fours and four sixes, setting the platform for
                    India's 356/9.
                    The world wakes up to Dhoni's potential.

                    helping India chase 301 with six wickets and 23 deliveries to spare.
                    Batting at No 3, his 145-ball hundred makes a stiff target look well short and India go up 3-0 in
                    the best-of-seven series.
                </li>

                    his life: 91* off 79 balls.

                    ICC's
                    major titles.
